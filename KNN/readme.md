This is a KNN algorithm with a functioning GUI to accompany it. Given a CSV with two columns, this program shows a basic implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. 

TODO:
1. [X] Establish the KNN algorithm 
    1. [ ] Clean up the code to work with more complex CSVs.
2. [X] Implement GUI
    1. [ ] Beautify the GUI
3. [ ] Switch from Python Lists to numpy library
